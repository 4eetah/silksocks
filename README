Multithreaded SOCKS proxy manager
The proxy manager is a socks proxy itself =)

The main things are:
- ability to use db as a storage for info about further forwarding and authentication to proxy
- daemon for constantly updating db with available proxies + proxies info
- threadpool, cache, fast non-blocking forwarding
